# 🎓 The Great Equalizer Myth: Education & the Racial Wealth Gap

This project explores how higher education in the U.S. fails to close — and sometimes even reinforces — the racial wealth gap, particularly for Black Americans. Through interactive scrollytelling, data visualizations, and a narrative-driven experience, this site challenges the myth that a college degree alone is the great equalizer.

## 📚 External Code & Libraries

### ✅ [KWK Scrollytelling Template](https://github.com/KnowledgeWorks-KW/scrollytelling-template)

* Adapted and customized the following components from the official KWK template:

  * `ObservedArticleText.svelte`
  * `Scroller.svelte`
* Significant modifications were made to fit the structure and visual design of my specific project.
Used them on this file:
  * `scene4.svelte`

### ✅ [scrollama.js](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama)

* Used Scrollama, a small JavaScript library for scroll-driven storytelling.
* I rewrote and integrated it into my Svelte project with the help of ChatGPT for guidance on syntax and implementation.

## 🛠️ APIs Used

### ✅ IntersectionObserver API (Native Web API)

* Used to detect when `.step` elements enter or leave the viewport.
* Drives scroll-triggered content updates and chart transitions.

## 📊 Data Visualization

### ✅ [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/)

* Interactive charts were embedded using Flourish’s iframe-based visualizations.
* The charts were created by me.

## 💬 Use of AI Assistance

I used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** as a tool for:

* Refining and improving my written content and narrative flow.
* Debugging and enhancing my CSS for layout consistency and responsiveness.
* Translating vanilla JavaScript code (like scrollama) into idiomatic Svelte code.
* Clarifying Svelte component structure and transitions.
